# Python-Data-Analytics-Project




Analyzing textual feedback is essential for extracting user sentiment and improving services. This project reads survey feedback entries from an in-memory data structure, lets users append more feedbacks, performs text cleaning, computes word-based insights, and summarizes ratings and unique vocabulary.

## What this project does
Starts with a preloaded dataset of 10 survey feedbacks (names, free-text feedback, rating 1–5).
Allows the user to add more feedback entries interactively.
Cleans feedback text by removing punctuation, trimming whitespace, collapsing multiple spaces, and converting to lowercase.
Counts how many feedbacks contain given keywords (case-insensitive).
Computes average rating, finds the longest feedback (by word count), and lists unique words used across all feedbacks.
